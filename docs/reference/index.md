!!! note "Special notations"
    Some signatures defaults to Ellipsis `...`, these are used for allowing specific parameters to not be provided on call, they are ignored and simply not provided, but they are required to exist before commiting the action, this is useful when the paramater is being added from another source, for example the `default_params` from a client.
